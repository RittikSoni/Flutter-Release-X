# Flutter Release X Example

A powerful CLI tool to build and release Flutter apps effortlessly. Generate release builds, upload to the cloud, and share QR codes and download links for quick and easy distribution.

## Installation

```bash
pub global activate flutter_release_x
```

## Usage

To build the release APK, upload it to GitHub, and generate a QR code:

```bash
flutter_release_x build
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file in the root directory of your project to specify your upload options and QR code generation settings:

```yaml
# e.g. C:/dev/flutter/bin/flutter.bat
flutter_path: FLUTTER/BINARY/PATH

upload_options:
  github:
    enabled: true
    token: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
    repo: REPO/PATH # e.g. RittikSoni/Flutter-Release-X
  google_drive:
    enabled: true
    credentials_path: /path/to/credentials.json
    client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

# QR Code generation settings
qr_code:
  enabled: true # Whether or not to generate QR codes
  save_file: true # Flag to save the QR code image to the file system (true/false)
  show_in_command: true # Flag to show the QR code in the command line output (true/false)
  size: 256 # The size of the generated QR code 256 x 256
  error_correction_level: L # Error correction level for the QR code (L, M, Q, H)
  save_path: "./release-qr-code.png" # Path where the QR code will be saved
```

### Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token

To enable your Flutter CLI tool to upload and delete releases on GitHub, you'll need to generate a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the appropriate permissions. Follow the steps below to create and configure your token.

#### Steps to Generate a GitHub Token

1. **Open the GitHub Token Generation Page**:

   - [Generate GitHub Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

2. **Set the Token Name**:

   - In the **Note** field, enter a descriptive name for your token, such as `Flutter Release X Token`.

3. **Select Scopes**:

   - Under **Select scopes**, check the following permissions:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
       - This includes access to public and private repositories, which is required for uploading and deleting releases.

4. **Generate the Token**:

   - Click the **Generate token** button at the bottom of the page.
   - Copy the token immediately, as you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

5. **Set Up Your Project**:

   ```yaml
   github:
     enabled: true
     token: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

### Google Drive Configuration

To upload files to Google Drive, follow these steps to set up your credentials:

1.  **Create a Google Cloud Project**:

    - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
    - Create a new project or select an existing one.

2.  **Enable the Drive API**:

    - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
    - Search for "Google Drive API" and enable it.

3.  **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:

    - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    - Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth Client ID**.
    - Configure the consent screen if prompted.
    - Set the application type to **Desktop App**.
    - Note down the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

4.  **Set Up Your Project**:

    ```yaml
    google_drive:
      enabled: true
      client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
      client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

    By following these steps, your application will be able to authenticate with Google Drive using the client ID and secret to upload files.
